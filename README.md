# My Personal Web Page
As is fairly obvious, this is my personal webpage. It's meant as something of a fancy, web resume. 

~~This project is written **entirely** in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks or any external resources are used. A considerable portion of the CSS and JavaScript was written with the help of StackOverflow, W3Schools, Fireship.io, CSS-Tricks, and many other sources found via Google.~~

This project was written using React.js with Gatsby.
